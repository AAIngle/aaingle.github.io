                <h1>Review</h1>
                <p>When I was first playing Outer Wilds, I couldn't stop thinking about 
                    it. The web of myserty is intricate and can be approached from any angle, 
                    the exploration and discovery are addicting, and the locations and characters are at once 
                    comforting and unlike anything else. It doesn't take long before the game 
                    gets its claws in you. And if the puzzles or planets aren't the first to 
                    do so, the music will probably be what gets stuck in your head. 
                    Even years later, the music makes me feel like I'm playing the game for the 
                    first time again. Which brings me to the first downside of Outer Wilds -- 
                    there's almost no chance of replayability. The puzzles aren't solved by 
                    getting items or gaining abilities; they're solved by how much you know
                     about the story, which isn't easy to forget. There's really only one ending
                     to the game, dialogue is limited and there isn't anything new to read once 
                     you've solved everything, and unless you haven't played the game's DLC yet,
                     there's no post-game content or new game plus.
                      The whole story takes maybe 20-30 hours but after that, the game has nothing left for you. It's a truly
                     unique and touching few dozen hours but many players feel an Outer Wilds shaped 
                     hole in their hearts for a long time after.
                </p>
                <p>This makes me biased, but my love for this game has grown like a pearl in my
                     mind; the more I think about it, the bigger it gets. I think many games are fun 
                     while they last, but don't really stick with you after credits roll. Outer Wilds
                     can't be more different than that. When I first reached the ending, it was actually
                      a bit underwhelimg to me -- I didn't really understand what had happened.
                     As I thought about it more for weeks, then months, then years, it has become
                      one of the most important stories to me. The emotional impact is often what 
                      inspires people who have played Outer Wilds to convince others to play it themselves; 
                    someone in my life convinced me on that premise and I convinced others after I played it. 
                    Unfortunately, this adoration and pressure from Outer Wilds fans can sometimes
                    intimidate other players. For as much as fans talk about this game, they don't talk
                    about the actual content of the game for fear of ruining the surprise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I'll have to do the same here -- it might be annoying if you've heard it before,
                    but this game is best enjoyed knowing as close to nothing about it as possible! If anything
                    about time-loop puzzles, space exploration, or cosmic mysteries strikes your fancy,
                     I can't recommend Outer Wilds enough.
                </p>
