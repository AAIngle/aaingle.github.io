                <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                <p>A stray cat accidentally finds itself in an abandonded futuristic walled city -- no longer
                    inhabited by humans, but by bots. In order to return to the outside, this cat
                    must explore the city, communicate with bots for help, and observe the remnants of humanity.

                <h1>Review</h1>
                <p>Maybe I'm in the dark about cat-type games, but I'm really surprised
                     there aren't more of them. It's unsurprisingly charming to play as this
                     willful kitty in this walled-in cyberpunk city. Even though this protagonist is
                     a bit more mysterious than usual, since this cat can't talk, the music is a more 
                     expressive companion. I interpreted the music as a window into the cat's mindsent -- 
                     it's curious, percussive, ebbing, flowing, and responsive. 
                     Apart from the protagonist though, the environment design is the real main event. Every piece of
                     clutter makes the place feel alive, and every place's clutter has a unique 
                    kind of life on display. One location is filled with litter, old woven cloth, 
                    and rusted metal; another with crates of goods, shiny plastic clothes, and neon
                     lights; and another with flowers, wood, and string lights. I wanted to soak in
                     every inch of each major location. My only complaint is that movement as 
                     the cat was more limited than I expected. For example, you can't jump onto 
                     just anything you want -- a button prompt is what allows the jump to happen.
                     I'm understanding of limitations in games, especially in the context of indie 
                     games, but the disappointment was still present. I got over it fairly quickly,
                     but that doesn't stop me from imagining a freer experience while exploring.
                </p>
                <p>
                     The story has its strengths, although I understand why most people didn't
                     pay it much mind because the atmosphere and world are just that good. Great
                      atmosphere and world design is both obvious and seemingly effortless -- 
                    people may not be able to point out the details that make it good, but they know
                     a strong atmosphere instinctually. The plot you guide the cat through ends up
                     feeling like only a small part of a big world. It won't appeal to everyone's taste, 
                     but I think that's perfect for a story about a cat.
                </p>
