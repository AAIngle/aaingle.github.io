                <h1>Review</h1>
                <p>Elden Ring is a lot of things, but straightforward is not one of them.
                 No single player that has tried to analyze Elden Ring has the same ideas of 
                 what it did right and where it failed. Some people really like the combat,
                  that it has the most freedom in builds and playstyles among its soulslike peers;
                  others say that variety suffers from quantity over quality. Some people have 
                  dedicated dozens and dozens of hours to teasing apart Elden Ring's narrative; 
                  others say it doesn't have one at all. Some say the graphics are lazy and outdated;
                  others say the fantastical vistas and environments are masterful. I fall generally on the more
                   positive side of these opinions. Although I acknowledge that the scope of the 
                   game necessitated a lot of repeated content -- like eneimies, boss fights, assets, etc -- 
                I think trying to diversify that content while maintaining the same scope would've 
                been unrealistic. The Fromsoftware development team has proven over and over again 
                that they can make very precise and focused games; Elden Ring's ambitious size is what
                 sets it apart from the rest of their catalogue and that's worth the sacrifice of repeated 
                content if you ask me.
                </p>
                <p>Even with those repetitive aspects, Elden Ring is incredibly replayable. Part of the 
                ambitious scope was the variety of builds you can design in this game and that lends itself
                 perfectly to experimenting over the course of many playthroughs. I've only finished the game
                 three times, but my many, many hours in the game also stem from my excitement to try new builds 
                 in new plathroughs. I've played a pure mage build, a dexterity and arcane build, a pure dexterity
                 build, an intelligence and strength build, and still have ideas for new combinations in future runs
                 of the game. And that's not even mentioning the story. Despite what some players tell you,
                 there is an intricate and rich story to Elden Ring, and it's one that absolutely captivates me.
                 It's honestly too complicated to explain in a short review such as this, but its themes around 
                 family, trauma, revenge, regret, empire, religion, idealism, death, and more are so thought provoking
                 to me (and all those who cared to actually engage with the narrative).
                </p>
                <p>All that being said, as much as I want to recommend it to everyone, it is quite a time
                commitment. Your first playthrough of Elden Ring will always be your longest, 
                and that can be anywhere from 80 to 120 hours -- and even that might be a lowball estimation. 
                 I also wouldn't recommend it as someone's first game because of the inherent challenge, but it's not as difficult 
                 as people say either. Unlike many other games in the genre, there are many tools that players 
                 can use to make the game more suited to your skill level. I think that's part of what makes Elden 
                 Ring a great entry to the genre. So, I'd say if you feel tempted to play Elden Ring at all, 
                 don't get caught up in the discourse, the naysayers, or the toxic "get good" gamers and go for it.
